## Feature Tasks  
### Max-Heap
Create a `MaxHeap` Prototype using [lecture code](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d19/blob/master/20-hash-tables/lib/min-heap.js) as a starting point. 
### Sorting Method
Research and implement one of the following Sorting Methods:
* [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

Your function should take an integer array a a single argument and sort it in-place (e.g. mutate the array). You can use helper functions if you need extra arguments in your sorting procedure.

## Tests
* Unit test each method of your prototype.
* Unit test your sorting method. 

## Documentation
In your README.md describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of paramiters), the expected data for each paramiter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalued use). Feel free to write any additional information in your README.md.
